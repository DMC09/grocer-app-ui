## Motivation

Originally I was using the notes features in iOS to share grocery lists between my brother and I. However it proved to be very clunky and I could not find a free and simple solution. So I created my own in order to better manage our groceries. Additionally this is my first project i've done in some time since becoming a profesional. This is also a good representation of my evolutuion as a Software Engineer. 
	

## Features
Images for Stores/Lists and Items
Common Item Catalog
Shared Lists for Groups  

## Demo   

After signing in/up with your email or google account you will be able to use the Grocer App.

With the main workflow you have everything you need to manage your grocery lists. In the demo below you can see me demoing the following 

* Adding/Editing Stores 
* Adding/Editing/Completing items 
* Adding/Editing the Common Items Catalog


If you want to share you data with a group you can create a group and generate a share code so that others can join too. When in group mode members share data including stores/items/ and common items. 

In this demo you can see me showcasing some of the same features as before however all members are able share the same data without data becoming out of sync or stale. This can be useful for families to efficiently manage their grocery lists.
