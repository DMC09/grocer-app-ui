## Motivation

Originally I was using the notes features in iOS to share grocery lists between my brother and I. However it proved to be very clunky and I could not find a free and simple solution. So I created my own in order to better manage our groceries. Additionally this is my first project i've done in some time since becoming a profesional. This is also a good representation of my evolutuion as a Software Engineer.
